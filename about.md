## Brief 

Since mid 2017 I'm a portoflio management researcher @EDF Lab (Osiris Department). Prior to that I lead several IT projects for the sake of EDF optimisation & trading division. 

More detailled informations may be found in my resume [FR](/public/files/cv_bclair.pdf) / [EN](/public/files/cv_bclair_en.pdf) (last updated June 18).


The things I write here are my own views and does not engage my employer. 


## Activities

I'm currently focusing on 3 topics : 
* Electricy prices prevision using a fundamental approach. I aim to model next 5 years supply and demand equilibriums for the french electricity market 
* Hydraulic stocks optimization. 
* Computer science. The above two topics require extensive computations. Therefore i do write a lot of code and try evangelize my fellow researcher to HPC.
